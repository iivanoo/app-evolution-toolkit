<p>NOTE: For setting up the question paper, question no 1 will be set up from all the four sections
which will be compulsory and of short answer type. Two questions will be set from each of the four
sections. The students have to attempt first common question, which is compulsory, and one
question from each of the four sections. Thus students will have to attempt 5 questions out of 9
questions.</p>

Section-A</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Introduction to Communication: </b>Definition & means of communications; Digital and analog
signals: sign waves, square waves; Properties of signals: amplitude, frequency, phase;
Theoretical basis for data communication: Fourier analysis: Fourier series and Fourier
Transform (property, ESD, PSD and Raleigh) effect of limited bandwidth on digital signal.
</p><b>
<p align="center">Section-B</p>
<p>
Physical connections: </b>modulation, amplitude-, frequency-, phase- modulation; Data
encoding: binary encoding (NRZ), Manchester encoding, differential Manchester encoding.
Transmission Media: Twisted pair-, co-axial-, fiber optic-cables, and wireless media
Transmission impairments: attenuation, limited bandwidth of the channels, delay distortion,
noise, data rate of the channels (Nyquist theorem, Shannon limit). Physical layer interfaces:
RS 232, X.21
</p><b>
<p align="center">Section-C</p>
<p>
Communication modes: </b>simplex, half duplex, full duplex; Transmission modes: serial
parallel-transmission; Synchronizations: Asynchronous-, synchronous-transmission; Type of
services: connection oriented-, connectionless-services; Flow control: unrestricted simplex
protocol, simplex stop- and -wait protocol, sliding window protocol; Switching systems:
circuit switching; picketing switching: data gram, virtual circuits, permanent virtual circuits.
Telephone Systems: PSTN, ISDN, asynchronous digital subscriber line. Multiplexing:
frequency division-, time-, wave- division multiplexing.
</p>
<b><p align="center">Section-D</p></b>
<p>
<b>Transmission errors: </b>feedback-, forward-error control approaches; Error detection; Parity
check, block sum check, frame check sequences; Error correction: hamming codes, cyclic
redundancy check; Data encryption: secret key cryptography, public key cryptograph; Data
compression: run length encoding, Huffman encoding.
