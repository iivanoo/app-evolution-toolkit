<p>NOTE: For setting up the question paper, question no 1 will be set up from all the four sections
which will be compulsory and of short answer type. Two questions will be set from each of the four
sections. The students have to attempt first common question, which is compulsory, and one
question from each of the four sections. Thus students will have to attempt 5 questions out of 9
questions.</p>

<b>
	INTRODUCTORY CONCEPTS : 
	 </b>
	System/Plant model, types of models, illustrative examples of plants
and their inputs and outputs, controller servomechanism, regulating system, linear time-invariant (LTI)
system, time-varying system, causal system, open loop control system, closed loop control system,
illustrative examples of open-loop and feedback control systems, continuous time and sampled data control
systems. Effects of feedback on sensitivity (to parameter variations),stability, external disturbance (noise),
overall gain etc. Introductory remarks about non-linear control systems.System/Plant model, types of models, illustrative examples of plants
