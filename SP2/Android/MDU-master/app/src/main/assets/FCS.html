<p>NOTE: For setting up the question paper, question no 1 will be set up from all the four sections
which will be compulsory and of short answer type. Two questions will be set from each of the four
sections. The students have to attempt first common question, which is compulsory, and one
question from each of the four sections. Thus students will have to attempt 5 questions out of 9
questions.</p>

<b>
	INTRODUCTION: 
	 </b>
	Fuzzy control from an industrial perspective, knowledge-based controllers,
knowledge representation in KBC's.
<br>
<b>
	THE MATHEMATICS OF FUZZY CONTROL:
</b>
Vagueness, fuzzy logic versus probability theory, fuzzy sets, their properties &amp; operations on fuzzy sets,
fuzzy relations &amp; operations on fuzzy relations, the Extension Principle, Fuzzy propositions, The
Compositional Rule of Inference, Different implications, Representing a set
of rules.

<p>
<b>
FKBC DESIGN PARAMETERS: 
</b>
The PKBC architecture, choice of variables &amp; content of rules,
Derivation of rules, choice of membership functions, choice of scaling factors, choice of fuzzification
procedure, choice of defuzzification procedure, comparison and evaluation of defuzzification methods.

NONLINEAR FUZZY CONTROL: 
	 </b>
	  The Control Problem, The FKBC as a Non-Linear Transfer
Element, Types of FKBC such as PID-like FKBC, Sliding Mode FKBC, Sugeno FKBC.
