<p>NOTE: For setting up the question paper, question no 1 will be set up from all the four sections
which will be compulsory and of short answer type. Two questions will be set from each of the four
sections. The students have to attempt first common question, which is compulsory, and one
question from each of the four sections. Thus students will have to attempt 5 questions out of 9
questions.</p>

Section-A</b>

<b>
	Signals:
	 </b>
	 Definition, types of signals and their representations: continuous-time/discrete-time, periodic/nonperiodic,
even/odd, energy/power, deterministic/ random, one-dimensional/multi-dimensional; commonly
used signals (in continuous-time as well as in discrete-time): unit impulse, unit step, unit ramp (and their
inter-relationships), exponential, rectangular pulse, sinusoidal; operations on continuous-time and discretetime
signals (including transformations of independent variables).

	Fourier Transforms (FT): 
</b><br>
	 (i) Definition, conditions of existence of FT, properties, magnitude and phase spectra, Some important FT
theorems, Parseval's theorem, Inverse FT, relation between LT and FT.<br>
(ii) Discrete time Fourier transform (DTFT), inverse DTFT, convergence, properties and theorems,

functions of CT systems, poles and zeros, block diagram representations; discrete-time system functions,
block diagram representation, illustration of the concepts of system bandwidth and rise time through the
