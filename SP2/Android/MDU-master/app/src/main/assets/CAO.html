<p>NOTE: For setting up the question paper, question no 1 will be set up from all the four sections
which will be compulsory and of short answer type. Two questions will be set from each of the four
sections. The students have to attempt first common question, which is compulsory, and one
question from each of the four sections. Thus students will have to attempt 5 questions out of 9
questions.</p>
<p align="center"><b>
Section-A</b>
</p>
<p>
Boolean algebra and Logic gates, Combinational logic blocks(Adders, Multiplexers,
Encoders, de-coder), Sequential logic blocks(Latches, Flip-Flops, Registers, Counters) Store
program control concept, Flynn's classification of computers (SISD, MISD, MIMD);
Multilevel viewpoint of a machine: digital logic, micro architecture, ISA, operating systems,
high level language; structured organization; CPU, caches, main memory, secondary memory
units and I/O; Performance metrics; MIPS, MFLOPS.
</p><b>
<p align="center">Section-B</p>
</b><p>
Instruction set based classification of processors (RISC, CISC, and their comparison);
addressing modes: register, immediate, direct, indirect, indexed; Operations in the instruction
set; Arithmetic and Logical, Data Transfer, Control Flow; Instruction set formats (fixed,
variable, hybrid); Language of the machine: 8086 ; simulation using MSAM.
</p><b>
<p align="center">Section-C</p></b>
<p>
CPU Architecture types (accumulator, register, stack, memory/ register) detailed data path of
a typical register based CPU, Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle (typically 3 to 5 stage);
microinstruction sequencing, implementation of control unit, Enhancing performance with
pipelining. The need for a memory hierarchy (Locality of reference principle, Memory
hierarchy in practice: Cache, main memory and secondary memory, Memory parameters:
access/ cycle time, cost per bit); Main memory (Semiconductor RAM and ROM organization,
memory expansion, Static and dynamic memory types); Cache memory (Associative and direct
mapped cache organizations.
</p><b>
<p align="center">Section-D</p>
</b><p>
Goals of parallelism (Exploitation of concurrency, throughput enhancement); Amdahl's law;
Instruction level parallelism (pipelining, super scaling -basic features); Processor level
parallelism (Multiprocessor systems overview).
Instruction codes, computer register, computer instructions, timing and control, instruction
cycle, type of instructions, memory reference, register reference. I/O reference, Basics of
Logic Design, accumulator logic, Control memory, address sequencing, micro-instruction
formats, micro-program sequencer, Stack Organization, Instruction Formats, Types of
interrupts; Memory Hierarchy.
