<p>NOTE: For setting up the question paper, question no 1 will be set up from all the four sections
which will be compulsory and of short answer type. Two questions will be set from each of the four
sections. The students have to attempt first common question, which is compulsory, and one
question from each of the four sections. Thus students will have to attempt 5 questions out of 9
questions.</p>
